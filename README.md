## Aim
To demonstrate the ability of **text-to-image generation tools** to reproduce an existing image by crafting precise prompts. The goal is to identify key elements within the image and use these details to generate an image as close as possible to the original.

---

## Tools / LLMs for Image Generation
- **DALL·E (OpenAI)** – Text-to-image generation with high fidelity
- **Stable Diffusion** – Open-source model for flexible image outputs
- **MidJourney** – AI tool for artistic and creative image generation

---

## Procedure

| Step | Activity | Description |
|------|-----------|-------------|
| 1 | Analyze the Given Image | Observe objects, colors, textures, lighting, background, composition, and style. |
| 2 | Create the Basic Prompt | Draft a simple description of the main elements. |
| 3 | Refine the Prompt | Add details (colors, mood, textures, perspective, time of day). |
| 4 | Identify Style | Include artistic influence or style (e.g., watercolor, realism, cartoon). |
| 5 | Fine-Tune | Adjust prompts with more specific details (weather, shadows, tones). |
| 6 | Generate | Use DALL·E, Stable Diffusion, or MidJourney to generate the image. |
| 7 | Compare & Iterate | Compare the generated image with the original, refine prompts if needed. |

## Experiment

### Example 1: Landscape Image

**Original Image:**


**Prompts Used:**
1. `A serene landscape with mountains and a river.`
2. `A serene landscape during sunset with purple mountains, a calm river reflecting the colors of the sky, and a few trees along the shore.`
3. `A serene landscape during sunset with purple mountains, a calm river reflecting the sky, soft pastel clouds, and in the style of a watercolor painting.`

**Generated Image:**


**Comparison Report:**
- ✅ Colors closely match (purple mountains, sunset tones).
- ✅ River reflection reproduced well.
- ⚠ Tree details less prominent than in the original.
- ⚠ Needs refinement in cloud texture.

### Example 2: City Night Scene

**Original Image:**

**Prompts Used:**
1. `A city skyline at night.`
2. `A modern city skyline at night with tall skyscrapers, glowing windows, and reflections in the water.`
3. `A modern city skyline at night with skyscrapers, neon lights, reflections on water, cinematic lighting, in realistic digital art style.`

**Generated Image:**
![Generated City](generated_city.jpg)

**Comparison Report:**
- ✅ Lighting and neon tones reproduced effectively.
- ✅ Skyline silhouette very close to the original.
- ⚠ Reflections on water less detailed.
- ⚠ Window glow intensity slightly reduced.

## Deliverables

1. **Original Image(s):** Reference images provided.
2. **Final Generated Image(s):** Created using refined prompts.
3. **Prompts Used:** Documented in steps above.
4. **Comparison Report:** Table of similarities and differences.

## Conclusion
By using **detailed and iterative prompts**, text-to-image models can generate images that closely resemble original visuals. The results highlight that:

- Prompt **specificity** directly affects image quality.
- Iterative refinement improves accuracy in **colors, lighting, and textures**.
- Tools like **DALL·E, Stable Diffusion, and MidJourney** are effective for both **creative** and **practical applications**.

This experiment demonstrates the **importance of prompt engineering** in AI-assisted image generation and its potential for design, art, and real-world visual reproduction.
